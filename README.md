## Primary Contributions

1) We propose BS-LDM, an LDM-based framework for high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images, and introduce ML-VQGAN for effective perceptual compression and detail retention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to train and evaluate LDMs for the bone suppression task.
    

2) To enhance the quality of generated images, we incorporate offset noise in the forward process, and temporal adaptive thresholding in the reverse process. These strategies help minimize discrepancies in low-frequency information, thereby improving the interpretability of the soft tissue images.

    
3) Our comprehensive experiments, as well as clinical and automated downstream evaluations demonstrated excellent image quality and substantial diagnostic improvements, underscoring the clinical significance of our work.
    

## Proposed Method

Overview of the proposed BS-LDM: (a) The training process of BS-LDM, where CXR and noised soft tissue data in the latent space are transmitted to the noise estimator for offset noise prediction and L2 loss calculation; (b) The training process of ML-VQGAN, where a multi-level hybrid loss-constrained VQGAN is used to construct a latent space by training the reconstruction of CXR and soft tissue images, using a codebook to represent the discrete features of the images; (c) The sampling process of BS-LDM, where the latent variables obtained after each denoising step are clipped using a temporal adaptive thresholding strategy for the sake of contrast stability.

## Detailed Clinical Evaluation Results

### Image Quality Assessment
The soft tissue images generated by the BS-LDM on the SZCH-X-Rays dataset were independently evaluated for image quality using established clinical criteria that are commonly applied to assess bone suppression efficacy. Three radiologists, with 6, 11, and 21 years of experience respectively, conducted these evaluations at our partner hospital. The average scores for lung vessel visibility, airway visibility, and the degree of bone suppression were 2.758, 2.714, and 2.765, respectively, out of a maximum score of 3. These findings indicate that BS-LDM effectively suppresses bone while preserving fine details and lung pathology.

### Diagnostic Utility Assessment
The diagnostic value of soft tissue imaging was independently evaluated by two radiologists with 6 and 11 years of experience, following the X-ray diagnosis standard. This analysis employed the SZCH-X-Rays dataset for bone suppression, using computed tomography to confirm lesions, which included common lung diseases such as inflammation, tuberculosis, and masses or nodules. Out of 818 data pairs assessed, 79 pairs contained one or more of these lesions. The radiologists independently evaluated both conventional CXR and the soft tissue images generated by our model. The findings suggest that the soft tissue images produced by BS-LDM enable more thorough and accurate lesion diagnosis compared to CXR images, thereby confirming its high clinical diagnostic value.
